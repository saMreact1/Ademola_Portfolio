          <h4>Scope</h4>
          <p>
            As a cross-border payment product, Send requires a certain level of KYC checks as part of anti-fraud 
            setups and government regulations. However, oftentimes, users find it difficult to complete this verification 
            process due to the technicalities arising from expected actions like live image capture.

          <h4>Expected Fix</h4>
          <p>
            Working on these two projects, I was tasked with making it easier for users to complete their KYC verification 
            process with little or no help from the Customer Support team, thereby reducing the number of incomplete KYC checks 
            and successful onboarding on both apps.

          <h4>First fix - introducing the user to requirements early on</h4>
          <p>
            In the onboarding flow, users are meant to provide basic personal details first before moving on to the third-party 
            platform for verification. To prepare them properly, as soon as they were done with the basics, I ensured that the 
            first screen afterward told them exactly what they needed to complete the verification – a government-issued ID.

          <h4>Second fix – creating a checklist for users</h4>
          <p>
            While in the earlier version, we had agreed on a checklist in the second page, the placeholder copy by the designer 
            here wasn’t exactly clear or helpful to the user. Took feedback from the PM and made a new checklist for the user as 
            shown in the screenshot below.

          <p class="img-txt">After</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>Third fix – briefly educate the users to increase verification success rates</h4>
          <p>
            One of the major issues we realized while taking feedback from the Customer Experience team was that a lot of users:
          </p>
          <p>1. Did not know how to take correct images</p>
          <p>2. Used expired or damaged IDs</p>
          <p>3. Submitted ID types that were not acceptable on the platform.</p>
          <p>
            To enable them to take the right actions while taking pictures or uploading IDs, I suggested slides within the verification 
            flow that clearly mentioned how to do the right thing. This would educate the user about the process in real-time, while 
            increasing their chance of completing the process.
          </p>

          <h4>Final words – making a compromise on extra screens</h4>
          <p>
            As a team, we realized that this meant additional screens in the verification flow. As the Content Designer on the team, 
            I realized that successful KYC verification required nudging and guiding our users towards completion. So, this meant 
            making a little compromise on extra screens if it was going to increase the chances of users successfully verifying their identity.
